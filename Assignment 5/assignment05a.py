#### Part 1
##
## The questions in Part 1 refer to the data in the file
## 'fastfood2.csv'.  The file has several columns: "storenum"
## gives the store number, "secs" that gives the number of seconds 
## to fill the order, "dayofweek" gives the day of the week,
## "meal" gives which meal ordered, "drinkonly" is Yes if only
## a drink was ordered, "cost" gives the amount spent in cents.

##  (a) Determine the proportion of meals that were for Lunch.
##  (b) Determine the mean time for each day of the week.
##  (c) Find a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of "drink only"
##      orders for each of Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.  Does there appear
##      to be any difference among the three meals? 
##  (d) Find the mean cost for each of the meal types.
##  (e) Find the proportion of meals of each type, for each day of the week.
##  (f) Identify all stores with average order fill time 2 standard 
##      deviations below the mean average fill time for the 892 stores. 
##      (These are the high performing stores.) Similarly, identify all 
##      stores with average order fill time 2 standard deviations above 
##      the mean average fill time for the 892 stores. (These are the 
##      low performing stores.). For each, sort the store number from 
##      smallest to largest.
##      Note: Here the standard deviation is of the set of 892 store
##      averages, not of the 100,288 separate order times.
##  (g) Some stores claim that using the mean is unfair due to outliers.
##      Repeat part (f) using the median in place of the mean, and determine
##      which stores (if any) are in both "high performing" groups or both
##      "low performing" groups.

## NOTE: Assignment 5 is in two parts. Assignment 5b will be posted soon.
