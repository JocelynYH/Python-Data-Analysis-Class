#### Part 1
##
## The questions in Part 1 refer to the data in the file
## 'fastfood1.csv'.  The file has two columns, "storenum"
## that gives the store number, and "secs" that gives the 
## number of seconds required to fill the order.

##  (a) Determine the average amount of time required to fill
##      all orders in the data set.
##  (b) Find the maximum and minimum amount of time required to
##      fill an order.  Then determine the number of orders with
##      the maximum time, and the number of orders with the minimum time.
##  (c) Determine the average amount of time required by store 777 to fill
##      its orders.
##  (d) Determine the number of records from store 321 in the data set. 
##  (e) Find the mean number of seconds 
##      needed to fill an order by stores 700-750.
##  (f) Find a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of orders for 
##      stores 500-600 that required more than 200 seconds to fill.
##  (g) Determine the number of distinct stores in the data set.
##  (h) Determine which store has the lowest mean order time, and which
##      store has the highest mean order time.
##  (i) Determine the median number of orders for a single store.

#### Part 2
##
## The questions in Part 2 refer to the data in the file
## 'samplegrades.csv'.


##  (a) Compute the mean and sample standard deviation for 
##      both the Course Average and the SAT Writing score.
##  (b) Find the mean Final exam score for all females
##      in the class.
##  (c) Repeat (b), this time for all males in the TR930
##      section.
##  (d) Compute the mean Homework score for all 1st-years
##      and then for all 4th-years.
##  (e) Find the probability that a randomly selected 2nd-year
##      was in the MW200 section.
##  (f) Sort the DataFrame on the CourseAve
##      variable, then determine the mean course average
##      for the students with the top-20 averages.
##  (g) Determine the bottom-10 final exam scores for 
##      students in the MW200 section.
##  (h) Among the students in the top-20% for APDE,
##      determine the percentage that finished in the
##      top-20% for course average.
##      (The top-20% is the top 113 stduents.  Be careful of ties!)
